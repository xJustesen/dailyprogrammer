    '''
    The Havelâ€“Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory solving the graph realization problem.
    That is, it answers the following question:
            Given a finite list of nonnegative integers, is there a simple graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list

    This function takes a finite list of nonnegative integers as input (seq) and solves the graph
    realization problem, ouputting either True or False
